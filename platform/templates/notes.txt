    *** Need to think of how to use WA as a checker
    *** Can I upload images?



WA Notes:
    WA doesn't do well with text other than "solve" 
        Ex (not working): Solve for x by completing the square: 2x^2 - 8x + 3 = 0

Checking bad inputs:
    solve 2x^2 - 8x + 10 = 0 
    x = 2 - i 
    x = 2 + i

    ['x = Â± 3']





GPT inputs:
The answer should only be in the following format: [math problem]"
    Led to ['Solve for x: x^2 + 6x - 7 = 0 by completing the square.']



Next steps:
    Fix math formatting ---- but really fix GPT prompt
    Small: fix the %20 in the URL
