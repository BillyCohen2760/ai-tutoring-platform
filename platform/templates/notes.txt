    *** Need to think of how to use WA as a checker
    *** Can I upload images?



WA Notes:
    WA doesn't do well with text other than "solve" 
        Ex (not working): Solve for x by completing the square: 2x^2 - 8x + 3 = 0

Checking bad inputs:
    solve 2x^2 - 8x + 10 = 0 
    x = 2 - i 
    x = 2 + i
